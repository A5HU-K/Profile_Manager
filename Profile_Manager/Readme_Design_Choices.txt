Suggestions to modularize the code, remove redundancies, and improve the overall architecture for better performance and scalability. 
Elaborating on the architectures and design patterns used, and suggest some additional enhancements to further improve the application's structure, scalability, and maintainability.

Architectures and Design Patterns Used:

Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture:
The backend is structured following the MVC pattern, with models (User.js), controllers (authController.js), and views (handled by the frontend).

Layered Architecture:
The backend is organized into layers: routes, controllers, models, and middleware.

Singleton Pattern:
Used for database connection (in config/database.js).

Factory Pattern:
Implemented in the error handling utility (utils/errorHandler.js).

Middleware Pattern:
Used for authentication and error handling middleware.

Repository Pattern:
Partially implemented in the User model, can be extended further.

Dependency Injection:
Used in the frontend with React Context (AuthContext).

Higher-Order Components (HOC):
Implemented with the PrivateRoute component for protected routes.

Custom Hook Pattern:
Used with the useAuth hook for accessing authentication context.
